# Light-organ-with-MCR100-tyristors

You can see it in function at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDfT2gDvR0c (Youtube forced me to MUTE the song it was played on the radio and which activated the light organ.)

The schematics uses sensitive MCR100 tyristors, which require less than 200 microAmps current in the gate for switching ON. The activated light bulbs are power supplied from 110 V AC, but exactly the same schematics should work fine from 220 V AC, too, since the tyristors work up to 600 V. 

The sensitivity of each channel is adjusted with a 10 K potentiometer. The sound is collected by an electret microphone and amplified by two BJT transistors. The schematics is sensitive enough to pick up voices from the room.
